Add option to disable individual input/output on recipes from being included in total calculation
	Would like to be able to disable individual inputs/outputs from being included in the total calculation.
	For example, if a recipe has a byproduct that is not used in the factory, it should not be included in the total calculation.
	Similarly, if an input is being supplied externally and should not be included in the total calculation, it should be able to be disabled.

	Add a checkbox next to each input/output in the recipe modal to enable/disable it from the total calculation.
	When disabled, the input/output should be visually indicated (e.g., greyed out).


	Or we could just allow the user to click the input/output itself to toggle it on/off for inclusion in the total calculation.
	When disabled, the input/output should be visually indicated (e.g., greyed out).




Add recipe modal
	Would like the option to input either a multiplier, or input one of the inputs or one of the outputs and have the rest be caclulated on the fly.


So "Add Recipe" button
	Modal opens
		Select recipe from dropdown
			Model renders inputs and outputs as "input fields"
			    if a field is changed, the rest are recalculated based on the recipe ratios
		"Add Recipe" button to confirm and add to factory
